# Find software jobs the way that Darwin intended

The tech industry is not for the weak.  Our skills are

We've all embraced the need to plan our careers carefully, learn constantly, and adapt quickly to succeed.  When you leave the certainty of one job in search of another, why should your process be any different?

**NextRole** organizes the job changes of software engineering professionals by tightly integrating documentation, search, and analytics into a single app experience for macOS.

## Documentation

NextRole is fundamentally a journal to track your job search.  You're not documenting your life's work, but it *makes your life's work possible*, so it prioritizes quick updates and <a href="https://commonmark.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean formatting</a>.  That way you can keep notes without learning anything new and get back to coding.

## Search

Including specialized job search and integrated browsing into NextRole makes it easier to update your journal about exciting leads while allowing the app to help you organize what you've found.

## Analytics

The combination of journaling, specalized search and integrated browsing allows NextRole to automatically update your journal with useful context.  As you manually update your journal and NextRole automatically adds data, the documentation grows more informative over time, creating a virtuous cycle that makes it an even stronger resource tomorrow.
