# Find software jobs the way that Darwin intended

The tech industry is not for the weak.  Our skills are

We've all embraced the need to plan our careers carefully, learn constantly, and adapt quickly to succeed.  When you leave the certainty of one job in search of another, why should your process be any different?

**NextRole** organizes the job changes of software professionals by tightly integrating documentation, search, and analytics into a single app experience for macOS.

## Documentation

**NextRole** is fundamentally a journal to track your job search.  You're not documenting your life's work, but it *makes your life's work possible*, so it prioritizes quick updates and <a href="https://commonmark.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean formatting</a>.  That way you can keep notes without learning anything new.

## Search

Including specialized job search and integrated browsing into **NextRole** makes it easier to update your journal about exciting leads while the app organizes what you found.

## Analytics

The combination of journaling, specalized search and integrated browsing allows **NextRole** to update your journal with useful context.  As you manually update your journal and **NextRole** automatically adds data, the documentation grows more informative over time, creating a virtuous cycle that makes it an even stronger resource tomorrow.

## Land your best job

The industry isn't like it was five or ten years ago.  It isn't enough to have picked up a hot technology, send out a handful of resumes, and expect to get your choice of offers.  Now we have AI interviewing us and the smallest companies are building software with massive scale, while the goalposts for our skills are moved by miles every year with the next developer conference or third-party partnership.

If you agree that you should organize your job hunt like the rest of your work, you could cobble your plan together with Notes, Safari and Numbers...

Or just use **NextRole** and get back to coding.

Your choice.
